/*
 (probably bad) Idea for multi threading
 
 the main thread focuses plays the whole game without any visual output.
 It never ever reads or writes to the board class.
 
 Drawing on the board is entirely handled by a sperate thread,
 which is constantly checking the Coords values from the main thread,
 updating the symbols onto the board accordingly.
